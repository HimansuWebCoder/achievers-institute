## 🧠 Why I Built This

This project was developed as a freelance assignment for an educational institute client. It helped me sharpen my frontend workflow, master layout and spacing techniques, and deliver a clean, performance-optimized user interface. The project reflects my ability to translate real-world client needs into a polished, responsive Core Stack (Html, Css, Js) application.
